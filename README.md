## About

This repository demonstrates the integration of:
- **FastEndpoints**: A minimalist and performant web framework for .NET.
- **Dapper**: A high-performance micro-ORM for efficient database operations.

The goal is to provide a foundational understanding of using these libraries together for creating scalable, maintainable, and fast APIs in .NET.

---

## Features

- Implementation of FastEndpoints for clean and declarative API endpoint definitions.
- Integration of Dapper for optimized database querying and mapping.
- Sample project showcasing best practices for using these tools together.
- Lightweight, high-performance design ideal for modern .NET applications.
